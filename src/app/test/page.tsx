                                The Straw Hats accidentally float down into the
                                Marine base, G-8. Forced to abandon ship, the
                                crew must make their way through the base to
                                reclaim the Going Merry and avoid
                                capture.\n\nThe crew manage to safely reach
                                their next island, Long Ring Long Land. They
                                meet a nomad who's been stuck on the island for
                                a while and offer to help him. But before they
                                can, they're challenged by a pirate who calls
                                himself Foxy the Silver Fox in a game of \"Davy
                                Back Fight\", where the losers can lose their
                                crew members.\n\nOne night as the crew rest, a
                                boy with a seahorse-shaped flute plays it near
                                the ship. The next day the crew awaken with
                                their memories of each other wiped out, except
                                for Robin. It's up to her, who was the only one
                                not affected, to get the crew's memories back
                                and find out the cause of it.\n\nThe Straw Hat
                                pirates later re-encounter Foxy, Porche, and
                                Hamburg. This encounter leads to a fight, and
                                also leads to the encounter with Aokiji.
